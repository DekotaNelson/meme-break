# How It's Made:
Tech used: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, MVC, Cyclic, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilizes Node.js and Express to create the backend of our app. Our brainy backend connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose to store all the important meme data. We then used EJS for our frontend views, and added some extra flair with some awesome CSS and SASS styles.

It follows the MVC architecture to keep our code organized and easy to maintain. And I used Cyclic to deploy our app to the web, making it easy to access for everyone.

# Lessons Learned:

    How to work with MongoDB and build document-oriented databases

    Building scalable and efficient web apps with Node.js and Express

    How to use EJS to create dynamic views and pass data to them from the backend
